# Deep Learning Codes

This repository is used to implement some deep learning models I've read in the papers or books, or just come up in my mind.

The models are mainly implemented using tf.keras 

## Already implemented models(updating)

* [2019-9-16] *Transfer Learning* : [Siamese Neural Networks for One-shot Image Recognition[ICML2015]](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~rsalakhu/papers/oneshot1.pdf), main code in Tasks/TransferLearning/OneShotLearning_Omniglot.py
* [2019-9-26] *Session Recommendation* : [A Simple Convolutional Generative Network for Next Item Recommendation]()ï¼Œmain code in Tasks/SessionRecommendation/SimpleConvNetForNextItem.py

# Datasets Added

* Omniglot Dataset
* Labeled Faces in the Wild(Deepfunneled, deleted folders with only one picture)
